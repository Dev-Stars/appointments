# appointments

Imitation of a Yelp's find table component. This component takes the date the,
time, and the part size for your appointment and stores in a mysql database.

This project comes with fake data intended to simulate business details which
can be loaded into the project using the db/loadFake.js file. To initiate
the database and run the file, read db/readme.txt.
